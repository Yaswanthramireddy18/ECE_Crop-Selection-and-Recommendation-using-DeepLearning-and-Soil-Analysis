# Extended Project Abstract  

The extended project builds upon the mini-project, aiming to integrate soil pH analysis with land region classification for crop selection and recommendation. While the initial phase classified soil types using a deep learning model, this extended version focuses on leveraging additional soil parameters, particularly pH levels, to determine optimal crops for specific regions.  

The project begins with collecting and preprocessing a dataset of land region images paired with soil pH values.  
A multi-stage approach is implemented, where the CNN model classifies soil types, and an additional decision system processes pH values to suggest suitable crops.  

Key technologies include TensorFlow for deep learning and Python for data processing and analysis. Integrating soil classification and pH-based crop recommendation supports precision farming by providing actionable insights to farmers.  

This project addresses real-world challenges, such as poor crop yields caused by mismatched soil conditions and cultivations. Additionally, it leverages AI/ML to optimize agricultural productivity, offering scalable solutions for diverse geographical regions. A publicly available dataset sourced from Kaggle has been utilized in this project to ensure performance and model accuracy.  

Key outcomes include a hybrid system capable of identifying land regions, analyzing soil quality, and recommending crops with high accuracy.  
Future work may extend this project to include additional soil parameters, such as moisture levels and nutrient content, for more comprehensive agricultural decision-making.

## Extended Project Objectives  
- To help farmers improve crop production by offering useful insights based on soil conditions.  
- To plan future updates by including other factors like soil moisture and nutrients for better results.  
- To create a system that identifies soil types and uses pH values to suggest the best crops for different areas.
