# Mini Project Outcome:  

**Mini Project Code**: PROJ2999    
The mini-project focused on **region classification** using deep learning techniques, specifically targeting land regions such as sandy, clay, black, and alluvial soil.

## Key Achievements  
1. Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying land regions.  
2. Leveraged **pre-trained models** such as VGG16 and ResNet to enhance classification accuracy.  
3. Addressed **class imbalance** using class weights during training to improve model performance.  
4. Achieved a validation accuracy of **80%**, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in classifying various land regions.
