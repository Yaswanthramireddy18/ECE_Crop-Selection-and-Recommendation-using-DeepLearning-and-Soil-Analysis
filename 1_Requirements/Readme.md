# Requirements for the Extended Project  

---

## High-Level Requirements (HLR):  
1. **Soil Type Classification System**  
   - Develop a CNN model to classify soil types (sandy, clay, black, alluvial) from land region images.  
2. **pH Value Integration**  
   - Collect and preprocess soil pH data and integrate it into the decision-making system.  
3. **Crop Recommendation System**  
   - Use the classified soil type and pH value to recommend optimal crops for specific regions.  
4. **Scalability**  
   - Ensure the system can scale to diverse geographical regions with varying soil types and pH values.  
5. **Technology Stack**  
   - Leverage TensorFlow for deep learning and Python for data processing and analysis.  
6. **Dataset Sourcing**  
   - Use publicly available datasets, such as those from Kaggle, for training and validation.

## Low-Level Requirements (LLR):  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather a dataset of land region images paired with corresponding pH values.  
   - Ensure proper labeling and organization of the dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Resize, normalize, and augment land region images for input into the CNN model.  
   - Handle missing or erroneous pH data to maintain data quality.  
3. **CNN Model Development**  
   - Implement and train a CNN model for soil type classification.  
   - Experiment with pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet for better accuracy.  
4. **Decision System for Crop Recommendation**  
   - Implement a logic-based decision system that takes soil type and pH as input to suggest crops.  
   - Optimize the decision-making system to account for edge cases (e.g., neutral pH values).  
5. **Training and Validation**  
   - Use class weights to address class imbalance in the soil type classification dataset.  
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for robust model evaluation.  
6. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Evaluate the CNN model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
   - Test the recommendation system's accuracy by comparing its results with expert recommendations.  
7. **System Integration**  
   - Combine the CNN classification model with the pH-based recommendation logic into a single pipeline.  
   - Ensure seamless flow of data between soil classification and crop recommendation stages.
